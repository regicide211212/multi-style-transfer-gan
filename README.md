# Multi-Style Image Transfer Based on Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository contains my thesis project on **multi-style image transfer using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. The project explores how GANs can be applied to generate artistic images by combining multiple style references into a single output.
